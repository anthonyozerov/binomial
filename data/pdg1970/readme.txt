Datasets of measurements of particle properties.

Values taken from PDG Review of Particle Properties, August 1970.
"Ground truth" taken from PDG Review of Particle Physics, 2024

Commented rows are either not included in PDG's August 1970 average
OR included in modern average (and thus should be excluded to not
bias towards the "ground truth")
