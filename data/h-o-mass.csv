# ratio of mass of oxygen to mass of hydrogen
# Data taken from "A Recalculation of the Atomic Weights", Clarke, 1910, pg. 29
# true value: 15.999/1.0080=15.87202381
# Uncertainties given are PROBABLE ERROR, not 1sigma!!!
# Under Normal assumption, can convert prob. err. to 1sigma by dividing
# by 0.6745 (see pg. 9)
# Clarke aggregated to 15.8779 with proberr 0.00016
