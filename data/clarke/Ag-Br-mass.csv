# ratio of mass of silver to bromine is Ag:Br
# if Ag:Br = 100:x, this table is the value of x
# the true value of (79.904/107.8682) * 100 = 74.075584834
# Data taken from "A Recalculation of the Atomic Weights", Clarke, 1910, pg. 87,91,92
# Uncertainties given are PROBABLE ERROR, not 1sigma!!!
# Under Normal assumption, can convert prob. err. to 1sigma by dividing
# by 0.6745 (see pg. 9)
# Clarke aggregated to 74.0802 with proberr 0.00029
