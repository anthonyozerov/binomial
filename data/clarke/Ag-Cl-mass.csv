# ratio of mass of silver to chlorine is Ag:Cl
# if Ag:Cl = 100:x, this table is the value of x
# the true value of x is (35.453/107.8682) * 100 = 32.866961718
# Data taken from "A Recalculation of the Atomic Weights", Clarke, 1910, pg. 79,82,83
# Uncertainties given are PROBABLE ERROR, not 1sigma!!!
# Under Normal assumption, can convert prob. err. to 1sigma by dividing
# by 0.6745 (see pg. 9)
# Clarke aggregated to 32.8606 with proberr 0.00031
