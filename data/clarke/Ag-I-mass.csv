# ratio of mass of silver to iodine is Ag:I
# if Ag:I = 100:x, this table is the value of x
# the true value of x is (126.90447/107.8782) * 100 = 117.6368071
# Data taken from "A Recalculation of the Atomic Weights", Clarke, 1910, pg. 98
# Uncertainties given are PROBABLE ERROR, not 1sigma!!!
# Under Normal assumption, can convert prob. err. to 1sigma by dividing
# by 0.6745 (see pg. 9)
# Clarke aggregated to 117.6351 with proberr 0.00034
